# sxmInfo

View what's currently playing on any Sirius XM channel on your Mac.

Inserts a menu item into the staus bar with the song info, including album art, etc.

Since I play sxm while I work via the Alexa skill, this is useful for me, may or may not be for others.

### ToDo items:
* Add a Channel Well, where you can drop your favorite channels
* Refine timing of polling ( sxm via Alexa seems to lag broadcast a bit ? )
* code cleanup
* remove dependency on AlamoFire / AlamoFireImage
* iOS version!
